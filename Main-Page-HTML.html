    <p id="summmary">Hypatia was a philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who lived in Alexandria, Egypt. Hypatia is the earliest female mathematician whose work is well known. She lived from 370 CE (debated) to 415 CE and was the daughter of mathematician Theon of Alexandria. Nothing is known of her mother. Hypatia lived in Alexandria during a time of conflict between religions, which ultimately lead to her murder. </p>

      <p>Here is a timeline leading to Hypatia's murder:</p>
      <li><strong>370 CE - </strong>Hypatia is born in Alexandria</li>
      <li><strong>390 CE - </strong>Hypatia teaches philosophy, science, and mathematics at the University of Alexandria. Her teachings and philosophies are considered pagan and Neoplatonic. The bishop of Alexandria, Theophilus, was opposed to Neoplatonism, but regarded Hypatia as an ally nonetheless.</li>
      <li><strong>412 CE - </strong>Cyril becomes Patriarch of Alexandria.</li>
      <li><strong>414 CE - </strong>Cyril closes all synagogues in Alexandria and expels Jews from the city. Orestes, friend of Hypatia, is outraged by Cyril's actions, and writes a letter to the emperor. This leads to a riot which a group of clerics, under the order of Cyril, nearly kill Orestes. Orestes has the initiator of the riot publicly executed. Although recommended to end, the feud between Orestes and Cyril continues.</li>
      <li><strong>415 CE - </strong>Hypatia is travelling home when her carriage is raided by a mob of Christians. The mob takes her to a pagan temple, strip her naked, and kill her by cutting her flesh with tiles, gouging her eyes, and tearing her body to pieces. Later, her limbs were dragged and burned through the city of Alexandria.</li>
      <p><strong>Aftermath - </strong>Being one of the first murders of a philosopher, the news of Hypatia's murder spreads quickly. For centuries, philosophers were deemed untouchable during public violence.</b>
